Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI technologies aim to enable machines to mimic human intelligence by analyzing data, recognizing patterns, and making predictions. 
Key aspects of AI:
Learning: AI systems can learn from data and adapt to new situations. 
Reasoning: AI can draw inferences and make logical deductions based on available information. 
Problem-solving: AI can identify and solve problems, often using algorithms and data analysis. 
Decision-making: AI can make informed decisions based on learned patterns and data analysis. 
Perception: AI can process and interpret sensory information, such as visual and auditory data. 
Natural Language Processing (NLP): AI can understand, interpret, and generate human language. 
Speech Recognition: AI can translate spoken words into text or vice versa. 
Machine Vision: AI can "see" and interpret images and videos. 
Applications of AI:
Autonomous vehicles: Self-driving cars rely on AI for navigation and decision-making. 
Robotics: AI powers robots in various fields, from manufacturing to healthcare. 
Customer service: AI-powered chatbots can handle customer inquiries and provide support. 
Healthcare: AI is used for diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug discovery. 
Finance: AI is used for fraud detection, risk assessment, and algorithmic trading. 
Education: AI can personalize learning experiences and automate grading. 
Types of AI:
Narrow AI (Weak AI): AI systems designed for specific tasks, like virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa).
General AI (Strong AI): AI systems capable of performing a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence (currently theoretical).
Super AI: AI systems that surpass human intelligence (currently theoretical).
